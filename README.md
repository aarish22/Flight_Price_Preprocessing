## Overview

The flight price preprocessing pipeline is designed to handle raw flight price data, clean it, and transform it into a format suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Features

- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features and encoding categorical variables.
- Data normalization: Scaling numerical features for better performance in machine learning models.

## Installation

To use the preprocessing scripts, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-price-preprocessing.git
